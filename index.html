                        <p>
                            I'm a software engineer trying to gain more skills and add value to a
                            team. For the past 9 years I have been a commercial driver. My time in 
                            this profession has allowed me to see all lower 48 states from the 
                            view of a windshield. Though I have enjoyed my time in that industry,
                            it is now time to challenge myself in the pursuit of a new goal.

                            This was the first project I did while in Thinkful. It is a 10 question quiz on Javascript, 
                            Html and Css built using those languages.

                            This was the second project I did while in Thinkful. It is an application that keeps all of your
                            bookmarks in on spot. You can add, delete, and filter by minimum rating. The project was built using
                            JavaScript, HTML, CSS, jQuery, and RESTful API.

                        I always loved playing with and building computers. Most of my family uses computers that I built.
                        Coding and software were always a fascination but I spent many years just watching tutorials and 
                        never actually building anything. Feeling unfulfilled in my previous profession, I decided that it
                        was time to make a change. I learned of coding bootcamps and decided to do the Thinkful program
                        because their reviews were very positive and the curriculum looked to be comprehensive. After 
                        thinkful I want to work for a company with a solid team structure and great programmers to learned
                        from.
